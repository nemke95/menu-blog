This is Exercise mainly for useContext hook. 


contextPage is my main page where I put whole logic and I'm taking all data from there to other Components.


Clicking on every modal you can see info about that specific item and on close button to close modal. 


Like button puts modal to Favourite section which appears if there are some favourite modal.


Search bar is for searching all items. Also random button if you are indecisive to suprise you !


Hope you like it. It is nothing to much, It's just good practice!
